Pre-Requisites
==============

You should be familiar with, but by no means an expert in, Clojure.

You should have `Leiningen <github.com/technomancy/leiningen>`_, the Clojure build tool, installed and be familiar with
editing a :file:`project.clj` file.

You should have an editor or IDE ready to go, set up for editing Clojure code.

A skim of the Lacinia reference documentation (the rest of this manual, outside of
this tutorial) is also helpful.
Or you can follow links provided as we go.
