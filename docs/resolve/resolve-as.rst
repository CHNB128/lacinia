Using ResolverResult
====================

A field resolver usually just returns the resolved value, or (for a list type) a seq of resolved values.

.. sidebar:: GraphQL Spec

   Read about :spec:`errors <Errors>`.

What if you want to add errors?
Field resolvers should not throw exceptions; instead, if there is a problem generating the resolved value,
they should use the ``com.walmartlabs.lacinia.resolve/resolve-as`` function to return a ResolverResult value.

.. sidebar:: Why not just throw an exception?

    Exceptions are a terrible way to deal with control flow issues, even in the
    presence of actual failures.
    More importantly, the ResolverResult approach allows more than a single error, and
    works well with Lacinia's
    :doc:`asynchronous processing features <async>`.

Errors will be exposed as the top-level ``:errors`` key of the execution result.

Error maps must contain at a minimum a ``:message`` key with a value of type String.
You may specify other keys and values as you wish, but these values will be part of the ultimate
result map, so they should be both concise and safe for the transport medium.
Generally, this means not to include values that can't be converted into JSON values.

Lacinia will add additional keys to the error map, to identify the query selection active when the
field resolver was invoked.
This includes location data related to the input query document.

When using ``resolve-as``, you may pass the error map as the second parameter (which is optional).
You may pass a single map, or a seq of error maps.
This first parameter is the resolved value, which may be ``nil``.

The order in which errors appear in the ``:errors`` key of the result map is not specified;
however, Lacinia does remove duplicate errors.

Tagging Resolvers
-----------------

If you write a function that *always* returns a ResolverResult, you should set the tag of the
function to be ``com.walmartlabs.lacinia.resolve/ResolverResult``.
Doing so enables an optimization inside Lacinia - it can skip the code that checks to see if
the function did in fact return a ResolverResult and wrap it in a ResolverResult if not.

Unfortunately, because of how Clojure handles function meta-data, you need to write your
function as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../_examples/tagged-resolver.edn
   :language: clojure

This places the type tag on the function, not on the symbol (as normally happens with ``defn``).

It doesn't matter whether the function invokes ``resolve-as`` or ``resolve-promise``, but returning
nil or a bare value will cause runtime exceptions, so be careful.
